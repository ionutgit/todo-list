# To Do List app 

This is an exercise from ZeroToMastery Academy - Web developer course (section10 - Dom Manipulation, video3 - Dom exercise)

## v.1.0.1

If you click on the list item, it toggles the .done class on and off.<br>
Add buttons next to each list item to delete the item when clicked on its corresponding delete button.<br>
When adding a new list item, it automatically adds the delete button next to it (items are clickable too!)<br>
